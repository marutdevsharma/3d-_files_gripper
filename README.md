# 3d-_files_gripper
A three-finger gripper is a versatile robotic end effector designed for grasping and manipulating objects of various shapes and sizes. Its design typically consists of three articulated fingers, each equipped with multiple joints that can adapt to the contours of the target object, providing a stable and secure grip. The fingers are often equipped with sensors to detect force and touch, enhancing the gripper's ability to handle delicate items without causing damage. This type of gripper is commonly used in industrial automation, research, and service robotics, where precise and adaptable handling is required. Its design allows for a balance between strength and dexterity, making it an ideal tool for complex manipulation tasks.

A three-finger gripper with two phalanges, proximal and distal, in each finger is designed for enhanced flexibility and control. Each finger is composed of a proximal phalanx connected to the base, followed by a distal phalanx at the tip. The joints between the phalanges and the base allow the fingers to bend and conform to the shape of the object being grasped. This configuration improves the gripper's ability to securely hold items with varying geometries and sizes.
